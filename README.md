### Experience
A 28 year career associated with technical projects, where a significant portion of time
has been developing client/project specific computer code. Expertise in team leadership,
product marketing, and both project and capital expenditures finance. A passion for coding
has resulted in an interest to focus intently on applying my expertise software application projects.

### Past Experience

<table>
<tr><td><li>&nbsp;</li></td><td>
Since 1989 I have been awarded multiple government Research and
Development grants as principal investigator with Department of Defense
(DOD), Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), NASA, and
Department of Energy (DOE).

</td></tr><tr><td><li>&nbsp;</li></td><td>
Marketing and product design efforts led to supply and service contracts
with leading aerospace companies that required applying optical and
thermal control coatings and optical sensor coatings (Parker-Hannifin,
Boeing, NASA, DOD). This work required meeting MIL-SPEC and NASA launch
payload Specs, and managing working groups of 2-16. Additionally the
production instrument PCB’s required fully MIL-SPEC and/or NASA
compliant hermetic sealing and vibration-shock resistance conformance
where I developed a fully compliant HS program meeting HAZMAT/OSHA
requirements.</td></tr></table>
